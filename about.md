I am [Milinda Pathirage]({{ site.url }}), a computer science PhD candidate interested in distributed stream processing systems and programming abstractions for distributed systems and stream processing. I write a blog here about interesting things related to research I am doing, programming and technology in general. I live in Bloomington, Indiana with my daughter and wife.
