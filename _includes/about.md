I am Milinda Pathirage, a computer science PhD candidate interested in distributed stream processing systems and programming abstractions for distributed systems and stream processing. I write a blog [here](http://milinda.svbtle.com) about interesting things related to research I am doing,  programming and technology in general. I live in [Bloomington, Indiana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana) with my daughter and wife. You can find my resume [here](/milinda-cv.pdf).

**I decided to move my blog to Medium. Please find my new posts at [https://medium.com/@mpathirage](https://medium.com/@mpathirage).**
