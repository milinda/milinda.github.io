As mentioned [here](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608040/big-data/fast-data--the-next-step-after-big-data.html), Big Data is not just big; it's also fast. Big data is often generated at incredible speeds from sources such as click-streams, remote sensors and logs generated by web services. At the internet scale these data sources are often unbounded (billions of users and devices keep generating more and more data every second), unordered and unstructured.

> Practicality dictates that one can never fully optimize along all dimensions of cor- rectness, latency, and cost for these types of input
